     * There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. Given the array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents
     * a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities fromi and toi, and given the integer distanceThreshold.
     *
     * Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at
     * most distanceThreshold, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.
     *
     * Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that
     * path.
     *
     * Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
     * Output: 3
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * 2 <= n <= 100
     * 1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
     * edges[i].length == 3
     * 0 <= fromi < toi < n
     * 1 <= weighti, distanceThreshold <= 10^4
     * All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.
