     * You are given a phone number as a string number. number consists of digits, spaces ' ', and/or dashes '-'.
     *
     * You would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then,
     * group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits
     * are then grouped as follows:
     *
     * 2 digits: A single block of length 2.
     * 3 digits: A single block of length 3.
     * 4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.
     *
     * The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should never produce any blocks of
     * length 1 and produce at most two blocks of length 2.
     *
     * Return the phone number after formatting.
     *
     * Input: number = "1-23-45 6"
     * Output: "123-456"
     *
     * Input: number = "123 4-567"
     * Output: "123-45-67"
