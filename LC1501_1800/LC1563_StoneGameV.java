     * There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in
     * the array stoneValue.
     *
     * In each round of the game, Alice divides the row into two non-empty rows (i.e. left row and right row), then Bob
     * calculates the value of each row which is the sum of the values of all the stones in this row. Bob throws away
     * the row which has the maximum value, and Alice's score increases by the value of the remaining row. If the value
     * of the two rows are equal, Bob lets Alice decide which row will be thrown away. The next round starts with the
     * remaining row.
     *
     * The game ends when there is only one stone remaining. Alice's is initially zero.
     *
     * Return the maximum score that Alice can obtain.
     *
     * Input: stoneValue = [6,2,3,4,5,5]
     * Output: 18

     * 1 <= stoneValue[i] <= 10^6
