     * Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for
     * their ith paper and citations is sorted in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's h-index.
     *
     * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at
     * least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.
     *
     * If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
     *
     * You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.
     *
     * Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
     * Output: 3
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * n == citations.length
     * 1 <= n <= 10^5
     * 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
     * citations is sorted in ascending order.
     * @param citations
     * @return
